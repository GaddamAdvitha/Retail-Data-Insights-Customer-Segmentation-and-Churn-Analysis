# Retail-Data-Insights-Customer-Segmentation-and-Churn-Analysis
Overview

This project involves the comprehensive analysis of retail data to gain insights into customer behavior, identify top customers, analyze churn, and understand monthly transaction trends. The project includes data cleaning, preparation, and visualization using Python.
Introduction

In this project, we analyze retail sales data to derive meaningful insights. We focus on customer segmentation, churn analysis, transaction behaviors, and monthly trends. The goal is to help businesses make data-driven decisions to improve customer retention and sales strategies.
Data Cleaning and Preparation

Steps taken to clean and prepare the data:
    Handled missing values and inconsistencies.
    Converted data types for analysis.
    Created new features for better insights, such as month_year and year.
Analysis
Top Customers Analysis
    Identified top customers based on transaction amounts and frequency.

Churn Analysis
    Analyzed customer churn to understand why customers stop purchasing.

Transaction Amount by Response
    Examined transaction amounts with respect to customer responses.

Monthly Trends Analysis  
    Analyzed monthly transaction trends to identify patterns and seasonality.

Customer Segmentation

Performed RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers into different categories:    
    P0: High-value, frequent customers with recent transactions.
    P1: Mid-value customers with moderate frequency and recency.
    P2: Lower-value customers with less frequent transactions.
Tools and Libraries   
    Python: Core programming language.
    Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
    Seaborn and Matplotlib: Data visualization.
    Scipy: Statistical analysis.
